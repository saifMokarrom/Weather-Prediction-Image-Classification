Here I have used 4 classes(cloudy, rainy, shine, sunrise) weather images. Download link of the images : https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/4drtyfjtfy/1
Then, I organize the images as follows:
train(0.7)
validation(0.1)
test(0.2)
Every set has 4 classes (cloudy, rainy, shine, sunrise)



While fitting the model, accuracy between train and validation set was 100% 
And finally after evaluating our model has an accuracy of more than 95%. 
For your better understanding, I tried to comment out beside the code
